# The secret QR game.

_this is a side project and does not reflect my code standard in work environments._

**How to play:**

Hide QR codes in your friend's house when no one is looking. Then tell them you hid QR codes all around their place and watch them go crazy trying to find them (prerequisites: friends that go crazy for games).
